          <hr />
          <p>Chandrayaan-3 is the third mission in the Chandrayaan programme, a series of lunar-exploration missions developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).Launched on 14 July 2023, the mission consists of a lunar lander named Vikram and a lunar rover named Pragyan, similar to those launched aboard Chandrayaan-2 in 2019.<br />

          Chandrayaan-3 was launched from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 14 July 2023.<br />

          The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August, and the lander touched down near the lunar south polar region[8] on 23 August at 12:33 UTC, making India the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon, and the first to do so near the region of the lunar south pole.On 3 September the lander hopped and repositioned itself 30 cm (12 in)-40 cm (16 in) from its landing site.<br />

          Vikram lander and Pragyan rover were set to sleep on 2 September and 4 September respectively due to depleting solar power with the Sunset on Lunar South Pole, it is being hoped that the Lander and Rover will again start working on the sunrise at the Lunar South pole, on September 22.</p>
